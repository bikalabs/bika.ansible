# Bika Ansible

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bikalims/bika.ansible.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bikalims/bika.ansible)

[Bika Ansible][6] provides a set of [Ansible Roles][7] to set up a
[Bika LIMS][1] installation on a Linux server.

Each role contains a `README.md` with further documentation.

> **Note:**
> Ansible Version >= 2 is required

## Getting started

Install dependencies using `ansible-galaxy`

    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml

Create an [Ansible Playbook][9], e.g. name it `bika.yml`:

    ---
    - hosts: all
      become: yes
      gather_facts: yes
      pre_tasks:
        - name: Update APT package cache
          action: apt update_cache=yes
      roles:
        - role: bika

Note: The `bika` role does a **full monty** installation.

If you want to selectively choose which parts you want to install, use a configuration like this:

    ---
    - hosts: all
      become: yes
      gather_facts: yes
      pre_tasks:
        - name: Update APT package cache
          action: apt update_cache=yes
      roles:
        - role: bika_base
        - role: bika_plone
        - role: bika_haproxy
        - role: bika_varnish
        - role: bika_nginx
        - role: bika_security
        - role: bika_munin
        - role: bika_postfix

Create an [Ansible Inventory][8] file, e.g. name it `bika_hosts.cfg`:

    [bika]
    bika ansible_ssh_host=192.168.33.10 ansible_ssh_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_private_key_file=.vagrant/machines/app/virtualbox/private_key

Run your [Ansible Playbook][9]:

    ansible-playbook -i bika_hosts.cfg bika.yml

Please refer to the `vagrant.yml` [Ansible Playbook][9] for a working example.


## Vagrant

This repository contains a running [Vagrant][10] setup, which creates a full
[Bika LIMS][1] installation, containing the following components:

- Bika Base Setup
- Bika Plone Installation
- Bika HAProxy (Load Balancer)
- Bika Varnish (Cache Proxy)
- Bika NGINX (Webserver)
- Bika Security (Firewall/Fail2Ban)
- Bika Munin (Monitoring)
- Bika Postfix (Mail)

### Vagrant Prerequisites

Please ensure you have a recent version of [Vagrant][10] installed on your machine:

    vagrant version
    Installed Version: 1.9.1
    Latest Version: 1.9.1

    To upgrade to the latest version, visit the downloads page and
    download and install the latest version of Vagrant from the URL
    below:

      http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

    If you're curious what changed in the latest release, view the
    CHANGELOG below:

      https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/v1.9.1/CHANGELOG.md

### Vagrant Commands

List available [Vagrant][10] commands:

    vagrant list-commands

List downloaded boxes:

    vagrant box list
    [...]
    trusty64        (virtualbox, 0)
    ubuntu/xenial64 (virtualbox, 20161209.0.0)


### Vagrant Setup

Start the [Vagrant][10] machine:

    vagrant up

This will download a Linux machine according to the `Vagrantfile` within this
repository. The server will listen on `192.168.33.10`.

You can access it via SSH:

    vagrant ssh

As soon as the machine is running, you can start the provisioning process:

    ansible-playbook -i vagrant_hosts.cfg vagrant.yml

> If you are using Vagrant < 1.7, you should read vagrant_hosts.cfg first,
> and uncomment the line with the correct private_key file path, or ansible
> will not be able to connect.

Open a browser and navigate to: http://192.168.33.10/bika_control_panel

Stop the [Vagrant][10] machine:

    vagrant halt

Destroy the [Vagrant][10] machine:

    vagrant destroy

## Dependencies

This role depends on the following Ansible Roles:

- [Plone](https://galaxy.ansible.com/plone/plone_server)
- [HAProxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/haproxy)
- [Varnish](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/varnish)
- [NGINX](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/nginx)
- [Firewall](https://galaxy.ansible.com/HanXHX/firewall)
- [Munin](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/munin)
- [Postfix](https://galaxy.ansible.com/tersmitten/postfix)


## Examples

To add worker zeo client, in configure.ymli add:

bika_plone_extra_parts:
    worker: |
        <= client_base
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        http-address = 127.0.0.1:{{ '%s' % (bika_plone_client_base_port|int + bika_plone_client_count|int + 1) }}

To add zeo client caching, in configure.ymli add:

bika_plone_client_extras: |
    zeo-client-client = ${:_buildout_section_name_}


## Troubleshooting

Problem:

The `plone_server` role is complaining about initial password not being set.

Solutions:

- Please ensure that your variables (where `bika_plone_initial_password` is
  set) are included in a `pre_task` of your playbook. See `vagrant.yml` and
  `vagrant_configure.yml` for details.

- Please ensure that your config is valid. E.g. the version pinning
  `bika_plone_additional_versions` is a list, so if you want to define no
  versions, add an empty list `[]` as its value.

- Please ensure you actually have an initial password set.
