Please note, that there is only **one** item supported below `bika_plone_config`
(Note the `-` below the variable).


## Convenience Variables

This role defines some convenience variables to easier overwrite some common
settings within the [Plone Server Role][4].

Note: Besides the `bika_user` variable, all listed variables are proxies of the
      defined variables within the [Plone Server Role][4] prefixed with `bika_`.

    bika_plone_instance_name: bikalims

Sets the name that discriminates this install from others. This name should be
globally unique on the server as it's used to discriminate between supervisor

    bika_plone_buildout_extra: |

in [mr.developer](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.developer) sources format. If
you specify plone_sources, the mr.developer extension will be used with
auto-checkout set to "*".
